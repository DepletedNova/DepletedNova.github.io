				<p class="Quote">"Am I capable of creating an abstract puzzle game?"</p>
			</div>
            <p style="textalign: justify;">
				I am chose this question in particular because it challenges my skillset 
				and my ability to think outside of the normal bounds of logic. The goal of the 
				project is, of course, to make an abstract puzzle game. <i>What has this consisted 
				of so far?</i> The game is a story-based game wrapped around the concept of time and 
				the interpersonal thoughts of the player.
			</p>
			<p>
				The timeline is a complete disaster to put it simply: I had been expecting to have made 
				some sort of Demo by this current stage and I can not say that I have anything that is 
				playable. A few challenges to be noted to causing this include a balanced schedule: school 
				and this large project need their own seperate times as they are on two different scales. 
				Another is the general mental toll that creating a game on your own can create: as this is 
				a larger project it is a bit of a more daunting task to undergo which can delay motivation 
				to continue work on it. I have devised a few ways to manage these and it's to simply create 
				a schedule; something to keep my time organized into bits that I can manage to work through.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now am I capable of creating an abstract puzzle game? I think the answer is a simple no. 
				Altough I do have the capability to do such I do not think I have the capacity or endurance. 
				I have great experience in programming and it is most likely the activity I spend the most 
				time on. This experience does not quite scale up to doing a very daunting project on your 
				own as that does require a higher mental capacity to fully flesh out and create (which is 
				why games usually have a team of three or more). I am more capable of smaller side-projects 
				in which that I can constantly divert focus into new things rather than the same monotonous 
				task. I will not be halting progress on the game but will continue trying my best but I do 
				not think that this is a capability of mine.
